In order to make this manageable, the assemblies will be included as stp files. Each one can then be imported as a part file into your favorite 3D modeling program. If you'd prefer to have component level control over your model, you can build the assemblies from the individual part files (./part_files/*.stp). 

To make things even more flexible, the complete original 3D model, in it's native format (autodesk inventor 2012) has been included as a zip file in the root directory of this repository as well.

If you're opening this in Inventor, in your project workspace create a folder called 'Shapeoko' (or some other meaningful name) and unzip the contents of the file into that folder. Be sure to select the appropriate project file prior to opening the top level assembly.
